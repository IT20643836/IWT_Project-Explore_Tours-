    </br>
      <p class="p1">Railways are like moving stories. They weren’t built for tourists originally, but for transporting food, workers or minerals. As you sit back and are transported across Ecuador the Scottish Highlands, along Halong Bay or the Alaska Highway you can see history unfold in front of your eyes. Similarly every passenger has a story on that train too. They are great places to people watch, or people meet.</p>
